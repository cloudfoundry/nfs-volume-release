# Both the below compilation items are test dependencies. The reason you see openssl3
# in here is that the openssl version shipped with xenial stemcells was too old to
# to compile > openldap-2.4.44 on 2023/11/01. Instead of adding logic to handle xenial vs.
# newer stemcell versions we opted to exchange the openssl it is compiled against to avoid
# complexity. We judged it safe since these test dependencies should not be able to
# interfere with production deployments.
